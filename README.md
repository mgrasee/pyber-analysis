# Pyber Analysis:

## Project Overview:
Analyze ride share data to determine trends.

## Resources:
1. Data:
   city_data.csv
   ride_data.csv
2. Software: 
   Python 3.8.5 and Visual Studio Code 1.56.2

## Pyber Results:
- Urban:
  - 62.7% of Total Fares
  - 68.4% of Total Rides
  - 80.9% of Total Drivers
- Suburban:
  - 30.5% of Total Fares
  - 26.3% of Total Rides
  - 16.5% of Total Drivers
- Rural:
  - 6.8% of Total Fares
  - 5.3% of Total Rides
  - 2.6% of Total Drivers

## Challenge Summary:

We can see from the data that the Urban city type is the biggest driver of revenue. I would believe we would want to continue to expand into more Urban areas. We can see Suburban is also a significant contributor to revenue as well. I would believe we may want to add additional Suburban drivers as they make up a relatively small amount of total drivers. We also may want to add additional Rural drivers, as this may help to increase revenue from the Rural city type since we also have a relatively small percentage of Rural drivers.
